# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

For this project we were given a collection of information from the ride sharing app PyBer. We imported this data to Pandas to create a summary dataframe, and used Pandas and Matplotlib to perform analysis and visualization. We created multiple types of visualizations to get a get a better overall idea of what information the data conveys.

### Purpose

Every business needs reliable and accurate information in order to make the best and most well-informed decisions. Our purpose with this analysis is to summarize and visualize the differences between the use of PyBer in rural, suburban, and city areas.
